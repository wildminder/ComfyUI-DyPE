# ComfyUI-DyPE Learnings

- Added structured diagnostics for Qwen CLIP encoders that do not expose a `transformer.model`. The exception now surfaces the object's key attributes, walks nested candidates (e.g., `clip.cond_stage_model._modules['clip']`), and emits the same snapshot via logging to help track down alternative attachment points when integrating unfamiliar CLIP implementations. The patcher now also traverses those same paths automatically to locate the first compatible transformer before giving up, and both DyPE nodes log INFO-level summaries of the parameters applied each time they run.
