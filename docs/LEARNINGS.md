# ComfyUI-DyPE Learnings

- Added structured diagnostics for Qwen CLIP encoders that do not expose a `transformer.model`. The exception now surfaces the object's key attributes, walks nested candidates (e.g., `clip.cond_stage_model._modules['clip']`), and emits the same snapshot via logging to help track down alternative attachment points when integrating unfamiliar CLIP implementations. The patcher now also traverses those same paths automatically to locate the first compatible transformer before giving up, and both DyPE nodes log INFO-level summaries of the parameters applied each time they run.
- Refactored the spatial patch pipeline so Qwen Image gains a dedicated DyPE node. The new embedder mirrors `EmbedND` output while applying YaRN/NTK scaling per-axis and syncing its dynamic schedule with the sampler wrapper. Noise-shift parameters are interpolated from the requested resolution, letting us expand Qwen’s rotary cache coherently at multi-megapixel targets.
